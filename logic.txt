there is only one kind of process step

19 unique tool id in all 19 files

one run id only has one tool id 

one tool id has many run ids

for each "Run ID" in metrology_df, each row corresponds to 49 measurement points located at consistent locations of the product surface

for each Sensor Name, there are 13 Step IDs

x = filtered_run_df["Time Stamp"].nunique()

each Sensor (A..O) takes a reading and outputs a value x number of times

each step is at a different time 

for each step, there are values for every sensor 

different steps take diff amount of time 

for one time frame, eg 2024-01-01 00:00:00 to 2024-01-01 00:12:35, there are 18 different tools working
each of the 18 tools only have one run
